# GitHub Codespaces using Flask

Welcome to your shiny new Codespace running Flask! We've got everything fired up and running for you to explore Flask.

You've got a blank canvas to work on from a git perspective as well. There's a single initial commit with the what you're seeing right now - where you go from here is up to you!

Everything you do here is contained within this one codespace. There is no repository on GitHub yet. If and when you’re ready you can click "Publish Branch" and we’ll create your repository and push up your project. If you were just exploring then and have no further need for this code then you can simply delete your codespace and it's gone forever.

To run this application:

```
flask --debug run
```

Project Proposal: Interactive Historical Timeline Web Application
Objective: The goal is to develop a web application using Python that creates an interactive historical timeline. This timeline will be inspired by the poster and video linked below:

Project Description: The web application will feature a timeline that visually represents significant historical events from 3300 BCE to the present day. The timeline will be structured as follows:

Vertical Axis (Time Flow):
-------------------------
The vertical axis will represent the flow of time, with each step corresponding to 100 years.
The midpoint of the chart will be year 1, with BCE (Before Common Era) years moving upwards and CE (Common Era) years moving downwards.

Horizontal Axis (Continents):
----------------------------
The horizontal axis will represent different continents: the Americas, Africa, Europe, Asia, and the Pacific.

Historical Periods:
------------------
The timeline will be divided into six main periods: the Early Bronze Age, the Bronze Age, the Iron Age, Classical Antiquity, the Middle Ages, and the Modern Period.

Additional Layers:
-----------------
Weather Events: Include significant weather events such as the 4.2 Kiloyear Event, with references to Randal Carlson's table of "cataclysmic events."
Diseases: Highlight major pandemics like the Spanish Flu and the Black Death that had a profound impact on human history.

Historical Context:
------------------
The timeline will start from 3300 BCE, marking the approximate beginning of recorded history with the advent of writing.
Prehistory, including the Stone Age, will be briefly covered, noting that Homo sapiens as a species date back approximately 200,000 years.
The three-age system (Stone, Bronze, and Iron Ages) will be highlighted, with a focus on how historical information was recorded through archaeology before 600 BCE.
Post-600 BCE, the timeline will include written records, starting with Herodotus, known as the "Father of History."

Technologies Used:
-----------------
Python: The primary programming language for backend development.
Flask/Django: Web frameworks for building the web application.
JavaScript & D3.js: For creating interactive and dynamic visualizations.
HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the web pages.
Expected Outcomes:

An interactive web application that allows users to explore historical events across different continents and time periods.
A visually appealing and educational tool that provides insights into the flow of history and the impact of significant events.
